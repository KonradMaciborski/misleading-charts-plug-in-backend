    colNoScl = 'Bright colours and/or no scale.\nUsing bright colours can may unnecessarily draw attention to the elements of the chart that the creator wanted to highlight, perhaps to confuse the reader. Furthermore technically, it is impossible to interpret data in unscaled graphs.'
    twoYaxes = 'Two y-axes.\nIt is used to compare two variables with different magnitudes and scales of measurement, in hopes of proving or disproving a trend. The problem is that dual-axis charts can alter the perception of the viewer, leading them to make the wrong conclusions.'
